# Music-Library-Organizer

This easy to use program is for every music lover who likes to keep their music library clean and tidy. 

	It will rename and move the audio files according this standard path :
			chosen output folder/artist name/album name/#-name of the song

	In addition the "start sorting" button will delete duplicates of exact same songs.

	The software will sort out all the content of the input folder(s) placing 
	the following type of files into different folders : 
	- the sorted audio files 
	- the full album files with their .cue files 
	- the audio files that can't be sorted will be moved to the following path :
			chosen output folder/Unknown Artist/Unknown Album 

	You can remove folders from the chosen input folders by selecting them and pressing the 'del' key.

	Once you sorted your folders you can use the clean button which does the following :
	- deletes empty folders
	- deletes corrupt/incomplete audio files
	- moves non-audio files to "other files" folder

	If you don't know what is .cue file and think you have any,
	it doesn't matter you can still use the program.
